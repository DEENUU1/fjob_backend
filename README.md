<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Fjob is a constantly developing project, every day I try to expand the application with new functionalities and enable the collection of data from as many websites as possible so that you don't miss any offer.

### Backend - https://kwlodarczyk.pro/admin
### Frontend - https://main.d3cjvuwb5x6i3c.amplifyapp.com/

## Key Features
- Advanced user system - JWT Authentication and functions to confirm operations with email
- The main endpoint, which returns a list of job offers, uses pagination, advanced searches and filtering
- Possibility to buy ads thanks to the integration of the application with the stripe platform
- Possibility to add advertisements to favorites and report irregularities
- Advanced administrator panel that allows you to track annual, monthly and daily statistics for all models
- Possibility to create a company account to post your own job offers - in the future, the option will be extended to add moderators to a given company profile
- Using Django signals and creating your own permissions to ensure that the application works efficiently and safely
